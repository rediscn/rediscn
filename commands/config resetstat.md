Resets the statistics reported by Redis using the `INFO` command.

These are the counters that are reset:

* Keyspace hits
* Keyspace misses
* Number of commands processed
* Number of connections received
* Number of expired keys
* Number of rejected connections
* Latest fork(2) time
* The `aof_delayed_fsync` counter

@return

@simple-string-reply: always `OK`.
